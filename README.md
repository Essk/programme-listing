# Programme Listing App

## Notes

### Project bootstrapped with create-react-app

As there is limited time in which to complete the project and the focus is on _code_, I've used create-react-app to hit the ground running.

### Implemented user stories:

As a user...

...I can see a table of programmes with the columns:

ID
Name
Description (use the shortDescription)
Active Status
...I can tell inactive programmes because the row appears greyed out.

...I can instantly filter rows of the table by programme name as I type into a text box.

...I can create a new programme and see it in the table.

...I can remove programmes from the table by clicking an 'X' icon in the last column of the table for each row.

...I can edit data for an existing programme and see the updated data in the table

### Still to be implemented:

...I can sort the table by name or ID by clicking on the relevant column header.

...if I close and reopen the web browser all data is in the same state.

### What I would focus on next:

- remaining user stories
- more robust test coverage
- better design / UX
